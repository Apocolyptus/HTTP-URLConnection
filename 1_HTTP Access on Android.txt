#HTTP Access on Android#

Most network-connected Android apps will use HTTP to send and receive data. Android includes two HTTP clients: HttpURLConnection
and Apache HTTP Client. Both support HTTPS, streaming uploads and downloads, configurable timeouts, IPv6 and connection pooling.

DefaultHttpClient and its sibling AndroidHttpClient are extensible HTTP clients suitable for web browsers. They have large and
flexible APIs. Their implementation is stable and they have few bugs.

But the large size of this API makes it difficult for us to improve it without breaking compatibility. The Android team is not
actively working on Apache HTTP Client.

HttpURLConnection is a general-purpose, lightweight HTTP client suitable for most applications. This class has humble 
beginnings, but its focused API has made it easy for us to improve steadily.

Since HTTPâ€™s Content-Length header returns the compressed size, it is an error to use getContentLength() to size buffers for the
uncompressed data. Instead, read bytes from the response until InputStream.read() returns -1.
